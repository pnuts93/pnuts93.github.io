			<h2><b>W</b>ho am I?</h2>
			<p>My name is Pietro, I am an italian Architect and Urban Planner and I am now studying software development at <a href="https://42wolfsburg.de/en/" target="_blank">42 Wolfsburg</a>. I am very interested in the challenges that environmental issues are posing to us as a society and in the role that the technological advancement can play in solving them.</p>

			<h2><b>W</b>here am I based?</h2>
			<p>I was born and raised in Cagliari, Italy, and over the years I have been living in different cities, mostly to study and to work: after earning my bachelor degree in Architecture, I moved to Venice to study Urban planning and environmental policy at the <a href="http://www.iuav.it/" target="_blank">Iuav University of Venice</a>. After the first year in Venice I moved to Lisbon for two semester to complete my Erasmus+ program and a traineeship abroad. Then I came back to Italy to work on my master thesis, which was going to be based on my upcoming experience in Milan with the City Resilience Department. After earning my master degree I kept working in Milan for 1 year, until I decided to move to Berlin, where I now live and study.</p>

			<h2><b>W</b>hy the portfolio?</h2>
			<p>While studying german and software development, I am also looking for a job, activity where building a portfolio helps me in two ways: the main reason is networking, which of course can be partially done on platforms as Linkedin or Xing, but nothing like a custom portfolio can showcase interests, skills and stilistic profile. The second reason that brought me to build this portfolio is actually upskilling and learning how to design a website, which, as the design of a printed portfolio does, certificates what someone can actually do.</p>

			<h2><b>W</b>hen have I started programming?</h2>
			<p>I started approaching programming during my second year of Architecture for personal interest, but then I kept learning for the simple reason that it is a very useful know-how, especially if you approach the study of cities, which are very complex organisms, reason why the analysis you might need to employ might be limitated by the use of a simple spreadsheet.</p>
